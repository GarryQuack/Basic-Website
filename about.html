    <h3><strong><u>Why in the world would you do this?</u></strong></h3>
    <p>Mostly for the pain but also this was a way to test if web development
        was my kind of thing (It kinda is). But most importantly this is a way to
        keep my programming skills in check and instead of doing random challenges
        I could make a website to show other skills. 
    </p>

    <h3><strong><u>How long did this take to make?</u></strong></h3>
    <p>This roughly took 3 weeks to get up to the text input. This includes breaks off
        and making the local server on my network.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><strong><u>Did you enjoy making this?</u></strong></h3>
    <p>Jury's still out for this one, it was fun making challenging my brain but also not
        a fun way to spend my vacation. Really makes a trip to Spain worse
