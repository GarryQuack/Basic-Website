<h1>I'm okay with programming</h1>

<p>Welcome! This is my website which I withered many hours away on. All of this is programmed
  by hand, no copy and paste. This is intended to be programming evidence for school but why not
  let other people get their hands on it? Please don't judge any bad parts of this, I am very new 
  and every page is just a test on certain features. Anyways have fun!
